<!-- Question 6)Rewrite the function using '?' or '//' Write a loop which 
prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number 
-ask them to input again.
The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number 
greater than 100 or cancles the input/enters an empty line.
Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. 
There's no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric  
input in this task -->
