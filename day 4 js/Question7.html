<!--An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided 
without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself
In other words, n> 1 is a prime if it can't be evenly divide by anything except 1
and n.
For example, 5 is prime number, because it cannot be divided without a 
remainder by 2 3 and 4
Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the intervqal from 2 to n .
for n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.
P.S. The code should work for any n  , not be hard tuned for any fixed value
