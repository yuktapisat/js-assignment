Question 2 ) Write the difference between var , let and const with code examples.

var -
The var statement declares a variable.
Variables are container for storing information.
It has global scope.

Examples -

a) var a = { name : "xyz" , age : "20" , city : "mumbai" }

b) var string

	var name = "yukta";

c) var number

	var age = 24;

d) var boolean 

	var canfly = false;

e) var array

	var cities = ['mumbai' , 'delhi' , 'pune' , 'thane'};

f) var objects
	
	var student = {
			name : "abc"
			hobby: "coding"
		      }

let - 

In the creation phase, the let variables are assigned storage spaces but are not initialized.
It has local scope.
Variables declared inside a block {} cannot be accessed from outside the block.

Examples - 

1)
{
  let x = 2;
}

2)
let i = 5;			//global
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++)	//local
{
console.log(i)
}


const -
It is basically constant whose value cannot be changed.
Variables defined with const behave like let variables, except they cannot be reassigned.
avaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared.
 Example -

	const PI = 3.14159265359;

You can change the elements of a constant array.
But you can NOT reassign a constant array

Examples -
	const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
	cars[0] = "Toyota";				//You can change an element
	cars.push("Audi");				// You can add an element
