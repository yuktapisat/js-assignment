Question 3 ) write a brief intro on available datatypes in Javascript.

DATATYPES IN JAVASCRIPT -

1) Javascript Booleans 
	Booleans can only have two values " true or false
	Booleans are often used in conditional testing.

Examples -
	var s = 7;
	var b = 7;
	(s == b) 	//true

2) Javascript Arrays -
	JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.
	Array items are separated by commas.
	Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on.

Example -
	var flowers = ['lotus' , 'rose' , 'sunflower'];

3) Javascript Objects -
	JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.
	Object properties are written as  "name:value"  pairs , separated by commas.

Example -
	var employee = { name:"pqr" , age :"30" , city : "mumbai" , designation : "manager"}

	The object (person) in the example above has 4 properties: name, age, city and designation.

4) Undefined -
	In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.
	Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. The type will also be undefined.

Example - 

	1)
		var car;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined 

	2) 
		car = undefined;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined 

5) Empty 
	An empty value has nothing to do with undefined.
	An empty string has both a legal value and a type.

Example -
	var car = ""; 

6) Null - 
	In JavaScript null is "nothing". 
	It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.
	In JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.

Example -

var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
person = null;
